PICO FIRST

A Mobile First, Content Defined Micro Grid
The pico first grid is a micro css grid. No base style. No resets. No framework. No defined breakpoints. Just a grid.

The grid is simple and gives you the designer more control of your pages. All columns start at 100% single column design
for mobile. As you have more space on you page you turn your grid on and off with min-width media queries.

The column widths are defined in a comment for reference. It is up to you to simply add in your media queries when you 
would like the grid to be active. This give you the control to turn the grid off and on based on your content and not 
device based breakpoints. Grids dont need to be complex to make complex layouts.
